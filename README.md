# Pack-Man-Java
Basic Pack-Man Game with using thread 

Pac-Man Game is played with the d-pad. You are White Circle and other colorful Circles are ghosts. You need to escape from them. 
Your purpose is to reach the big X onto the top left of your screen. Green squares are your award and each of them brings 10 points.
The game screen size is constant so if your screen size is smaller than 1000*1000 pixelation, you would change size from into the GameScreen.java.
Code part is : //setSize(1000,1000);

I used Java GUI units and object-oriented properties of the Java language.
I think this game is a simple and understandable object-oriented and thread using example.
